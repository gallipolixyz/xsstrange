    "Identify the reflected XSS vector in the search parameter.",
    "Craft a malicious URL to execute JavaScript code.",
    "Understand how reflected XSS can be exploited in PHP applications.",
    "Compare PHP-based XSS with client-side XSS."

  "hints": [
    "Try injecting a <script> tag in the search parameter.",
    "Check how the search term is displayed on the page.",
    "Look at the URL parameters after submitting the form.",
    "Notice the difference between client-side and server-side reflection."
